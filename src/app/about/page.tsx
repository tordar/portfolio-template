                        I'm a full-stack developer with experience in React, Next.js, and modern web technologies. 
                        I'm a largely self-taught developer, after beginning to learn Python during the pandemic, 
                        to accomodate my degree in international relations. From there, I went on to work for Norwegian 
                        Red Cross, maintaining their in-house developed web application Nyss. Here, I gained experience 
                        in working with the end-user, product ownership and managing a large codebase. I also enjoy 
                        working on different side-projects, trying to learn new technologies, and keeping up to date 
                        with new developments and ways of making things.
